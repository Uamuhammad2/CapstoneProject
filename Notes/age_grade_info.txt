Age performance % 
      = your time / age standard time

Age standard time 
      = open standard time (world record) / age factor (some number less than 1, calculated by Alan Jones)

         ie.  the record for male 5k trail run is 12:51 minutes
            if i am 37 y/o male, my factor is 0.9706 (calculated by Alan jones)
            the standard time for a 37 y/o male would thus be 13:14 minutes

            if i ran the event in 18 minutes, i'd have an age performance of 0.7352

Age graded time 
      = your time * age factor 
         ie.  18 minutes * 0.9706 = 17:47 (an estimate of what i'd run it in if i was prime age)
